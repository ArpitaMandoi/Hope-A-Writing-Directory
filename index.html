    <p>On a cozy winter night, shivering in the fog in the month of December, with a glimmering hope in those bright shining eyes. Even though the heart freezes to the depths, it believes it will keep beating for more. The strange fear threatens to shatter you from within, when it becomes difficult to breathe because you know it's not the end. Healthy yet weak, warm but frozen, even knowing youâ€™re losing it, you can do nothing but still determined to embrace it. In the darkness of silence with the ticking clock, your head is bursting with the loudness of fear. They push you, you let them do so. Thay frighten you, with tears at the brim of your eyes, you stand brave in the face of their fright. Exhausted, wearing a smile. Eyes asking for favour to collapse, pulse getting slower and slower seems to be disappearing somewhere in the silence, yet the heart aspires more, not ready to give up. 
    </p>
    <p>Innocence to the extent of infinity, struggling to stand up, to advance forward. As a myriad of voices, questions, grievances, and loudness try to burst out of the head, only one thought comes to mind: calmness. Panicking is considered the greatest enemy of the mind, she said. Panic and perfection follow parallel paths towards extinction. It just depends on how you choose to deal with it. 
    </p>
    <p>Trust, believe, surrender, with a heavy heart and uncertainity. As the strong rush of adrenaline courses through your veins, you get goosebumps when you see a bystander too close. A flashback of disturbing memories and nightmares flooded through. They took her away, holding by her neck as she looked back at me. It was the last time we saw each other. Those were all inevitable, but I didn't expect it to happen so soon. Her last words were etched in my mind, We will meet at the stars, I will wait for you.
        </p>
    <p>Harmony was something created by nature, until some tried to act superior over others. Those swift downpours in the early days of winter calling for its arrival puts them in a situation of discomfort or rather dangerous. Well, I am still figuring out which season is safer. Yearning for a shelter more than just love, with a hungry stomach. 
        </p>
    <p>Walking and discovering the world around me, bumping into those bright shiny moving creatures as monsters. Life should have been a choice. My eyes have seen death countless times. 
        </p>
    <p>Until one day, as I crossed the black path, I bumped into that monster again, and I lied there, just there. While it hurt, but unlike every other time I felt a sense of satisfaction and perhaps a smile on my face. I tried getting up, I groaned when it hurt more I gave up. Gazing at the stars in the night sky, I was excited at the prospect of finally meeting her. I closed my eyes, and that was the perfect night.
